# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Genetic predisposition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">90–95% of patients are HLA-B27 positive.</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- Initiation of innate immune response
- Release of cytokines (TGF-beta and TNF-α) and interleukins (IL-17 and IL-23)
- Infiltration of paravertebral and sacroiliac entheses with macrophages, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells
- Chronic enthesitis leads to: 
1. Erosion of the iliac part of the sacroiliac joints 
2. Vertical formation of syndesmophytes along the spinal ligament or around the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral discs (see “Syndesmophytes vs. osteophytes”)
3. Fusion of syndesmophytes → ankylosis of intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240331101610.png|Pasted image 20240331101610.png]]

# Clinical features
---
- Inflammatory back pain (sacroiliitis)
	- Insidious onset at age <40
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Morning stiffness > 30 minutes that improves with activity</span>
	- Pain is independent of positioning
	- Relieved with exercise but not rest
	- Nocturnal pain
- Reduced chest expansion & spinal mobility
- Enthesitis (tenderness at tendon insertion sites)
- Dactylitis (swelling of fingers & toes)
- Uveitis

# Diagnostics
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">AS is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, and there are no serologic tests to confirm the diagnosis.</span>
## Laboratory findings
- Elevated ESR & CRP
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HLA-B27</span>: Positive in 90–95% of patients with axial spondyloarthritis
- Autoantibodies (e.g., rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies) are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">negative</span>
## X-ray
- Sacroiliitis: bone erosions, subchondral sclerosis, eventual bony fusion (ankylosis)
- Bridging syndesmophytes: ossification at vertebral body margins <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(bamboo spine)</span>
