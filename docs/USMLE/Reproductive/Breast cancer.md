## Paget disease of the breast
- Definition: a rare type of breast cancer that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">affects the lactiferous ducts and the skin of the nipple and areola</span>
- Pathogenesis: migratory/epidermotropic theory: neoplastic ductal epithelial cells from an underlying DCIS or IDC  move through the lactiferous ducts and invade the surrounding epidermis of the nipple.
- Clinical features![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240412145835.png|Pasted image 20240412145835.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythematous, scaly, or vesicular rash affecting the nipple and areola</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus; burning sensation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nipple retraction</span>
	- Ulceration that causes blood-tinged [[./Nipple discharge|nipple discharge]]
- Diagnostics
	- Punch/wedge or surface biopsy of nipple tissue: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paget cells</span> confirm disease.

# Diagnostics

## Receptor testing
![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240311145001.png|Pasted image 20240311145001.png]]
- Hormone receptors (HR) positive
	- [[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] receptor
	- Progestogen receptor
- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu, c-erbB2) positive
- Triple negative
### Prognosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hormone-negative breast cancer has a poorer prognosis than hormone-positive breast cancer. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HER2-positive tumors show aggressive growth and metastasize quickly compared to HER2-negative tumors. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triple-negative disease is associated with a poor prognosis.</span>
