# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Risk factors
- Advanced age
- Neurologic disorder (e.g. [[../Neurology/Dementia|dementia]], stroke)
- Sensory impairment (e.g. [[../Neurology/Hearing loss|hearing loss]])
## Precipitating causes
- Central nervous system insult (e.g. seizure, stroke)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infection (e.g. [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]], urinary tract)</span>
- Medications(e.g. sedatives)
- Metabolic disturbances (e.g. electrolytes, uremia)

# Treatment

## Treatment of agitation in delirium
- Agitation should initially be managed with nonpharmacologic strategies.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid physical restraints as much as possible in older patients</span> with delirium, as they can worsen distress and agitation, as well as contribute to preventable injuries.
- Pharmacotherapy
	- [[./Antipsychotics|Antipsychotics]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotics]]: e.g., haloperidol (most commonly used)</span>
		- Atypical [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotic]] options
			- Risperidone
			- Olanzapine

>[!warning] 
>- Avoid [[./Antipsychotics|antipsychotics]] in patients with underlying [[./Alcohol withdrawal|alcohol withdrawal]] or benzodiazepine withdrawal (due to the risk of seizures) and in patients at high risk for QTc prolongation (due to the risk of [[../Cardiology/Torsades de pointes|torsades de pointes]]).
>- [[./Sedative-hypnotic drugs|Benzodiazepines]] are deliriogenic. Do not treat delirious patients with [[./Sedative-hypnotic drugs|benzodiazepines]] unless the delirium is due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
