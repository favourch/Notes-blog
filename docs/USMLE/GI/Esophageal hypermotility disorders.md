- Esophageal motility disorders include disorders of hypomotility (e.g., achalasia) and hypermotility (e.g., diffuse esophageal spasm).
- Distal esophageal spasm (DES; corkscrew esophagus): premature and uncoordinated nonpropagative esophageal peristalsis in at least 20% of swallows

# Clinical features

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intermittent dysphagia to liquids (and potentially, solids)</span>
	- Dysphagia predominantly to solids is more suggestive of a mechanical obstruction, e.g., a esophageal stricture, cancer, or ring.

# Diagnostics

## Manometry
- Procedure: measures the amplitude, length, and duration of the peristaltic waves via a nasogastric tube fitted with numerous pressure sensors 
- Findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal esophageal spasm: premature contractions in at least 20% of swallows </span>![[../../assets/img/L42493.jpg|L42493.jpg]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disorganized non-peristaltic contractions on esophageal manometry and "corkscrew" esophagus on barium esophagogram</span>
	- Hypercontractile esophagus: hypertensive esophageal contractions in at least 20% of swallows 
	- HRM may be normal between acute episodes

Esophageal motility disorders typically cause dysphagia with both solids and liquids. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysphagia predominantly with solids is suggestive of a mechanical obstruction</span> (intraluminal, mural, or extrinsic).
